Handling Precautions
Camera Care
This camera is a precision instrument. Do not drop it or subject it to physical
shock.
The camera is not waterproof and cannot be used underwater. If you
accidentally drop the camera into water, promptly consult your nearest
Canon Service Center. Wipe off any water droplets with a dry cloth. If the
camera has been exposed to salty air, wipe it with a well-wrung wet cloth.
Never leave the camera near anything having a strong magnetic field such
as a magnet or electric motor. Also avoid using or leaving the camera near
anything emitting strong radio waves such as a large antenna. Strong
magnetic fields can cause camera misoperation or destroy image data.
Do not leave the camera in excessive heat such as in a car in direct sunlight.
High temperatures can cause the camera to malfunction.
The camera contains precision electronic circuitry. Never attempt to
disassemble the camera yourself.
Use a blower to blow away dust on the lens, viewfinder, reflex mirror, and
focusing screen. Do not use cleaners that contain organic solvents to clean
the camera body or lens. For stubborn dirt, take the camera to the nearest
Canon Service Center.
Do not touch the camera’s electrical contacts with your fingers. This is to
prevent the contacts from corroding. Corroded contacts can cause camera
misoperation.
If the camera is suddenly brought in from the cold into a warm room,
condensation may form on the camera and internal parts. To prevent
condensation, first put the camera in a sealed plastic bag and let it adjust to
the warmer temperature before taking it out of the bag.
If condensation forms on the camera, do not use the camera. This is to avoid
damaging the camera. If there is condensation, remove the lens, card and
battery from the camera, and wait until the condensation has evaporated
before using the camera.
If the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery
and store the camera in a cool, dry, well-ventilated location. Even while the
camera is in storage, press the shutter button a few times once in a while to
check that the camera is still working.
Avoid storing the camera where there are corrosive chemicals such as a
darkroom or chemical lab.
If the camera has not been used for an extended period, test all its functions
before using it. If you have not used the camera for some time or if there is
an important shoot coming up, have the camera checked by your Canon
dealer or check the camera yourself and make sure it is working properly.

Handling Precautions

LCD Monitor
Although the LCD monitor is manufactured with very high precision
technology with over 99.99% effective pixels, there might be a few dead
pixels among the remaining 0.01% or less pixels. Dead pixels displaying
only black or red, etc., are not a malfunction. They do not affect the images
recorded.
If the LCD monitor is left on for a prolonged period, screen burn-in may occur
where you see remnants of what was displayed. However, this is only
temporary and will disappear when the camera is left unused for a few days.
In low or high temperatures, the LCD monitor display may seem slow or it
might look black. It will return to normal at room temperature.

Cards
To protect the card and its recorded data, note the following:
Do not drop, bend, or wet the card. Do not subject it to excessive force,
physical shock, or vibration.
Do not touch the card’s electronic contacts with your fingers or anything
metallic.
Do not store or use the card near anything having a strong magnetic field
such as a TV set, speakers, or magnet. Also avoid places prone to having
static electricity.
Do not leave the card in direct sunlight or near a heat source.
Store the card in a case.
Do not store the card in hot, dusty, or humid locations.

Lens

C

Y
P
O

After detaching the lens from the camera, attach the lens
caps or put down the lens with the rear end up to avoid
scratching the lens surface and electrical contacts.

Contacts

Cautions During Prolonged Use
If you use continuous shooting, Live View shooting, or
movie shooting for a prolonged period, the camera may
become hot. Although this is not a malfunction, holding the
hot camera for a long period can cause slight skin burns.

About smudges adhering to the front of the sensor
Besides dust entering the camera from outside, in rare cases lubricant from the
camera’s internal parts may adhere to the front of the sensor. If visible spots
remain on the image, having the sensor cleaned by a Canon Service Center is
recommended.

X When the battery is fully recharged,

the full-charge lamp will turn green.
It takes approx. 2 hours to fully recharge a completely exhausted
battery at 23°C / 73°F. The time required to recharge the battery
depends on the ambient temperature and the battery’s charge
level.
For safety reasons, recharging in low temperatures (6°C - 10°C /
43°F - 50°F) will take a longer time (up to 4 hours).

20

Charging the Battery

Tips for Using the Battery and Charger
Upon purchase, the battery is not fully charged.
Recharge the battery before using.
Recharge the battery on the day before or on the day it is to be
used.
Even during storage, a charged battery will gradually drain and lose
its power.
After recharging the battery, detach it and unplug the charger
from the power outlet.
When not using the camera, remove the battery.
If the battery is left in the camera for a prolonged period, a small
amount of power current is released, resulting in excess discharge
and shorter battery life. Store the battery with the protective cover
(provided) attached. Storing the battery after it is fully charged can
lower the battery’s performance.

C

Y
P
O

The battery charger can also be used in foreign countries.
The battery charger is compatible with a 100 V AC to 240 V AC 50/
60 Hz power source. If necessary, attach a commercially-available
plug adapter for the respective country or region. Do not attach any
portable voltage transformer to the battery charger. Doing so can
damage the battery charger.
If the battery becomes exhausted quickly even after being fully
charged, the battery has reached the end of its service life.
Purchase a new battery.

After disconnecting the charger’s power plug, do not touch the prongs for
at least 3 sec.
Do not charge any battery other than a Battery Pack LP-E10.
The Battery Pack LP-E10 is dedicated to Canon products only. Using it
with an incompatible battery charger or product may result in malfunction
or accidents for which Canon cannot be held liable.

21

Installing and Removing the Battery and Card
Load a fully-charged Battery Pack LP-E10 into the camera. The card
(sold separately) can be an SD, SDHC, or SDXC memory card. The
captured images are recorded onto the card.

Installing and Removing the Battery and Card

When the access lamp is lit or blinking, it indicates that images are
being written to or read by the card, being erased, or data is being
transferred. When the access lamp is lit or blinking, do not open the
card/battery compartment cover and never do any of the following.
Otherwise, the image data may be destroyed or the card or camera
may be damaged.
• Removing the card.
• Removing the battery.
• Shaking or banging the camera around.
If the card already contains recorded images, the image number might
not start from 0001 (→
).
Do not touch the card’s contacts with your fingers or metal objects.
If a card-related error message is displayed on the LCD monitor, remove
and reinsert the card. If the error persists, use a different card. If you can
transfer all the images on the card to a computer, transfer all the images
and then format the card with the camera (p.36). The card may then
return to normal.

C

The Image Stabilizer may not be effective if the subject moves at the time
of exposure.
The Image Stabilizer may not be effective for excessive shaking such as
on a rocking boat.
The Image Stabilizer can operate with the focus mode switch set to
either <f> or <g>.
If the camera is mounted on a tripod, you can save battery power by
switching the IS switch to <2>.
The Image Stabilizer is effective even when the camera is mounted on a
monopod.
Some IS lenses enable you to switch the IS mode manually to suit the
shooting conditions. However, the EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II and EFS55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS II switch the IS mode automatically.

Basic Operation
Adjusting the Viewfinder Clarity
Turn the dioptric adjustment

If the camera’s dioptric adjustment still cannot provide a sharp viewfinder
image, using Dioptric Adjustment Lens E (10 types, sold separately) is
recommended.

Preventing Camera Shake
Hand-held camera movement during the moment of exposure is called
camera shake. It can cause blurred pictures. To prevent camera shake,
note the following:
• Hold and steady the camera as shown on the previous page.
• Press the shutter button halfway to autofocus, then slowly press the
shutter button completely.

If you press the shutter button completely without pressing it halfway first
or if you press the shutter button halfway and then press it completely
immediately, the camera will take a moment before it takes the picture.
Even during the menu display, image playback, and image recording,
you can instantly go back to shooting-ready by pressing the shutter
button halfway.

C

Although it is daylight, the flash popped up.
For a backlit subject, the flash may pop up to help lighten the
subject’s dark areas.
In low light, the built-in flash fired a series of flashes.
Pressing the shutter button halfway may trigger the built-in flash to
fire a series of flashes to assist autofocusing. This is called AF-assist
beam. Its effective range is about 4 meters/13.1 feet.
Although flash was used, the picture came out dark.
The subject was too far away. The subject should be within 5
meters/16.4 feet from the camera.
When flash was used, the bottom part of the picture came out
unnaturally dark.
The subject was too close to the camera, and a shadow was created
by the lens barrel. The subject should be at least 1 meter/3.3 feet
away from the camera. If a hood has been attached to the lens,
remove it before taking the flash picture.

1 Full Auto Techniques
Recomposing the Shot

Depending on the scene, position the subject toward the left or right to
create a balanced background and good perspective.
In the <1> (Full Auto) mode, while you press the shutter button
halfway to focus a still subject, the focus will be locked. You can then
recompose the shot and press the shutter button completely to take the
picture. This is called “focus lock”. Focus lock is also possible in other
Basic Zone modes (except <5> Sports).

C

Shooting a Moving Subject

Y
P
O

In the <1> (Full Auto) mode, if the subject moves (distance to camera
changes) during or after you focus, AI Servo AF will take effect to focus
the subject continuously. As long as you keep aiming the AF point on
the subject while pressing the shutter button halfway, the focusing will
be continuous. When you want to take the picture, press the shutter
button completely.

44

7 Disabling Flash
In places where flash photography is prohibited, use the <7> (Flash
Off) mode. This mode is also effective for capturing the particular

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

Prevent camera shake if the numeric display in the viewfinder
blinks.
Under low light when camera shake is prone to occur, the
viewfinder’s shutter speed display will blink. Hold the camera steady
or use a tripod. When using a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end to
reduce blur caused by camera shake.
Taking portraits without flash.
In low-light conditions, tell the subject to keep still until the picture is
taken. If the person moves during the exposure, he or she might look
blurred in the picture.

2 Shooting Portraits
The <2> (Portrait) mode blurs the background to make the human
subject stand out. It also makes skin tones and the hair look softer than
with the <1> (Full Auto) mode.

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

The further the distance between the subject and background,
the better.
The further the distance between the subject and background, the
more blurred the background will look. The subject will also stand
out better in front of a plain, dark background.
Use a telephoto lens.
If you have a zoom lens, use the telephoto end to fill the frame with
the subject from the waist up. Move in closer if necessary.
Focus the face.
Check that the AF point covering the face flashes in red.
If you hold down the shutter button, you can shoot continuously to obtain
different poses and facial expressions. (Up to approx. 3 shots per sec. in
JPEG quality.)
If necessary, the built-in flash will pop up automatically.

3 Shooting Landscapes
Use the <3> (Landscape) mode for wide scenery, night scenes, or to
have everything in focus from near to far. The greens and blues also
become more vivid and the image sharper than with <1> (Full Auto).

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

With a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end.
When using the wide-angle end of a zoom lens, objects near and far
will be in focus better than at the telephoto end. It also adds breadth
to landscapes.
Shooting night scenes.
Since the built-in flash will be disabled, this
mode <3> is also good for night scenes.
Use a tripod to prevent camera shake.
If you want to photograph a person against
a night scene, set the Mode Dial to <6>
(Night Portrait) and use a tripod (p.53).

50

4 Shooting Close-ups
When you want to photograph flowers or small things up close, use the
<4> (Close-up) mode. To make small things appear much larger, use a
macro lens (sold separately).

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

Use a simple background.
A simple background makes the flower, etc., stand out better.
Move to the subject as close as possible.
Check the lens for its minimum focusing distance. Some lenses
have indications such as <40.25m/0.8ft>. The lens minimum
focusing distance is measured from the <V> (focal plane) mark on
the top left of the camera to the subject. If you are too close to the
subject, the focus confirmation light <o> will blink.
Under low light, the built-in flash will fire. If you are too close to the
subject and the bottom of the picture looks dark, move away from
the subject.
With a zoom lens, use the telephoto end.
If you have a zoom lens, using the telephoto end will make the
subject look larger.

51

5 Shooting Moving Subjects
To photograph a moving subject, whether it is a child running or a
moving vehicle, use the <5> (Sports) mode.

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

Use a telephoto lens.
Using a telephoto lens is recommended so you can shoot from afar.
Use the center AF point to focus.
Aim the center AF point over the subject, then press the shutter
button halfway to autofocus. During autofocusing, the beeper will
continue beeping softly. If focus cannot be achieved, the focus
confirmation light <o> will blink.
When you want to take the picture, press the shutter button
completely. If you hold down the shutter button, continuous shooting
(max. approx. 3 shots per sec. in JPEG quality) and autofocusing
will take effect.

Under low light when camera shake is prone to occur, the viewfinder’s
shutter speed display on the bottom left will blink. Hold the camera steady
and shoot.

52

6 Shooting Portraits at Night
To shoot someone at night and obtain a natural-looking exposure in the
background, use the <6> (Night Portrait) mode.

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

Use a wide-angle lens and a tripod.
When using a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end to obtain a wide
night view. Also, use a tripod to prevent camera shake.
Keep the person within 5 meters/16.4 feet from the camera.
Under low light, the built-in flash will fire automatically to obtain a
good exposure of the person. The maximum effective distance of the
built-in flash is 5 meters/16.4 feet from the camera.
Shoot also with <1> (Full Auto).
Since camera shake is prone to occur with night shots, shooting also
with <1> (Full Auto) is recommended.

Tell the subject to keep still even after the flash fires.
If you use the self-timer together with flash, the self-timer lamp will light
briefly after the picture is taken.

Safety Warnings
Follow these safeguards and use the equipment properly to prevent injury, death,
and material damage.

Preventing Serious Injury or Death
• To prevent fire, excessive heat, chemical leakage, and explosions, follow the
safeguards below:
- Do not use any batteries, power sources, and accessories not specified in this
booklet. Do not use any home-made or modified batteries.
- Do not short-circuit, disassemble, or modify the battery pack or back-up battery. Do
not apply heat or apply solder to the battery pack or back-up battery. Do not expose
the battery pack or back-up battery to fire or water. And do not subject the battery
pack or back-up battery to strong physical shock.
- Do not install the battery pack or back-up battery in reversed polarity (+ –). Do not
mix new and old or different types of batteries.
- Do not recharge the battery pack outside the allowable ambient temperature range
of 0°C - 40°C (32°F - 104°F). Also, do not exceed the recharging time.
- Do not insert any foreign metallic objects into the electrical contacts of the camera,
accessories, connecting cables, etc.
• Keep the back-up battery away from children. If a child swallows the battery, consult a
physician immediately. (Battery chemicals may harm the stomach and intestines.)
• When disposing of a battery pack or back-up battery, insulate the electrical contacts
with tape to prevent contact with other metallic objects or batteries. This is to prevent
fire or an explosion.
• If excessive heat, smoke, or fumes are emitted during battery pack recharging,
immediately unplug the battery charger from the power outlet to stop the recharging
and prevent a fire.
• If the battery pack or back-up battery leaks, changes color, deforms, or emits smoke or
fumes, remove it immediately. Be careful not to get burned in the process.
• Prevent any battery leakage from contacting your eyes, skin, and clothing. It can
cause blindness or skin problems. If the battery leakage contacts your eyes, skin, or
clothing, flush the affected area with lots of clean water without rubbing it. See a
physician immediately.
• During the recharging, keep the equipment away from the reach of children. The cord
can accidentally choke the child or give an electrical shock.
• Do not leave any cords near a heat source. It can deform the cord or melt the
insulation and cause a fire or electrical shock.
• Do not fire the flash at someone driving a car. It may cause an accident.
• Do not fire the flash near a person’s eyes. It may impair the person’s vision. When
using flash to photograph an infant, keep at least 1 meter away.
• Before storing the camera or accessory when not in use, remove the battery pack and
disconnect the power plug. This is to prevent electrical shock, heat generation, and
fire.
• Do not use the equipment where there is flammable gas. This is to prevent an
explosion or fire.

C

80

Y
P
O

• If you drop the equipment and the casing breaks open to expose the internal parts, do
not touch the internal parts due to the possibility of electrical shock.
• Do not disassemble or modify the equipment. High-voltage internal parts can cause
electrical shock.
• Do not look at the sun or an extremely bright light source through the camera or lens.
Doing so may damage your vision.
• Keep the camera from the reach of small children. The neck strap can accidentally
choke the child.
• Do not store the equipment in dusty or humid places. This is to prevent fire and
electrical shock.
• Before using the camera inside an airplane or hospital, check if it is allowed.
Electromagnetic waves emitted by the camera may interfere with the plane’s
instruments or the hospital’s medical equipment.
• To prevent fire and electrical shock, follow the safeguards below:
- Always insert the power plug all the way in.
- Do not handle a power plug with wet hands.
- When unplugging a power plug, grasp and pull the plug instead of the cord.
- Do not scratch, cut, or excessively bend the cord or put a heavy object on the cord.
Also do not twist or tie the cords.
- Do not connect too many power plugs to the same power outlet.
- Do not use a cord whose insulation has been damaged.
• Occasionally unplug the power plug and use a dry cloth to clean off the dust around
the power outlet. If the surrounding is dusty, humid, or oily, the dust on the power outlet
may become moist and short-circuit the outlet to cause a fire.

Preventing Injury or Equipment Damage

• Do not leave equipment inside a car under the hot sun or near a heat source. The
equipment may become hot and cause skin burns.
• Do not carry the camera around while it is attached to a tripod. Doing so may cause
injury. Also make sure the tripod is sturdy enough to support the camera and lens.
• Do not leave a lens or lens-attached camera under the sun without the lens cap
attached. Otherwise, the lens may concentrate the sun’s rays and cause a fire.
• Do not cover or wrap the battery-recharging apparatus with a cloth. Doing so may trap
heat within and cause the casing to deform or catch fire.
• If you drop the camera in water or if water or metal fragments enter inside the camera,
promptly remove the battery pack and back-up battery. This is to prevent fire and
electrical shock.
• Do not use or leave the battery pack or back-up battery in a hot environment. Doing so
may cause battery leakage or a shorter battery life. The battery pack or back-up
battery can also become hot and cause skin burns.
• Do not use paint thinner, benzene, or other organic solvents to clean the equipment.
Doing so may cause fire or a health hazard.

If the product does not work properly or requires repair, contact
your dealer or your nearest Canon Service Center.
